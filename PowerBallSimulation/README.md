#  PowerBall Simulation
###### This was one of the last assignments for my computer science 1 (introductory programming) class. It simulates the basic game for PowerBall through console input. This is a procedural implementation as object-oriented programming is taught in the class that followed this one. If I was writing this code today, I'd definitely consider an object-oriented implementation.

###### After running the program, just follow the prompts onscreen to enter the numbers you want to play with. It will randomly generate winning numbers to compare the user's input to.
